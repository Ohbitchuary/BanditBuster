-------------------------------------------------------------------------
TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF STAGE 3 LOGIC FOR CODE REVIEWERS:
- Directory.Exists: Safely verifies folder path validity natively.
- Directory.Delete(..., true): Natively purges the entire directory structure
  and hidden/system files recursively using built-in OS file handles.
- Process Overrides: If native .NET I/O catches an AccessDenied exception due
  to custom malware ACL adjustments, the program triggers external 'takeown'
  and 'icacls' binaries to violently reclaim full control.
